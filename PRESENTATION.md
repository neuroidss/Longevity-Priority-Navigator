# Longevity Priority Navigator

**From Noise to Signal: AI-Driven Strategy in Longevity Research**

*A Submission for the Agentic AI x Longevity Hackathon*

### **Slide 2: The Challenge & Our Solution**

**The Problem: A Chicken-and-Egg Stalemate**

-   The longevity field is flooded with data but starved for clarity.
-   **The Stalemate:** We need effective interventions to find good biomarkers, but we need good biomarkers to validate new interventions.
-   Researchers spend more time searching than synthesizing.

**Our Solution: An AI Research Strategist**

The Longevity Priority Navigator is not another search engine. It's an **insight engine**.

1.  **AI-Powered Validation:** It autonomously searches diverse sources (PubMed, Patents, Preprints) and uses AI to validate and prioritize **primary scientific literature**.
2.  **Strategic Synthesis:** Instead of a list of links, it generates a strategic briefing:
    -   A single, profound **Key Strategic Question**.
    -   High-impact **Research Opportunities** with justifications and confidence scores.
    -   An interactive **Knowledge Graph** to visualize the conceptual landscape.

### **Slide 3: The User Experience: From Query to Insight**

*(This section would be narrated over screenshots of the application)*

**1. The Knowledge Web (Screenshot 1)**
> "Here is the main analysis view. On the left, a dynamic knowledge graph visually connects genes, compounds, and hypotheses. On the right is the AI's briefing, highlighting a key intervention and its supporting sources. The user can interact with any node."

**2. Evolution Analysis (Screenshot 2)**
> "Our 'Trend Analyzer' agent provides a temporal view, showing which concepts are **Fading** and which are **Emerging**. This helps researchers understand the trajectory of the field and position their work for future impact."

**3. Interactive Exploration (Screenshot 3)**
> "The experience is fully interactive. Clicking a node on the graph brings up contextual questions for the AI assistant. The chat is aware of the entire analysis, allowing for deep, meaningful follow-up conversations that go far beyond the initial report."

### **Slide 4: Impact and Future**

**Why We're Different**
-   **Novelty:** We shift the focus from data retrieval to **strategic insight generation**.
-   **Biological Validity:** Grounded in a two-stage AI process that validates **primary scientific sources**.
-   **Future Impact:** By helping researchers identify the most critical questions, we aim to **accelerate the development cycle** for longevity therapies.

**Market Ready & Future Proof**
-   **Implementation:** Our prototype is a functional web app, ready for rapid deployment to research teams, pharma, and VCs.
-   **Future Roadmap:**
    -   **Agent Collaboration:** Adding a "Critic" agent to challenge findings.
    -   **Deeper API Integration:** Direct connections to scientific databases.
    -   **Long-Term Memory:** Vector DB for cross-session insights.

**Thank you.**
